# AI Benchmark - Hexagon Test

Prompt Challenge:

```
Write a Python program that shows a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon.
The ball should be affected by gravity and friction, and it must bounce off the
rotating walls realistically.
```

This challenge tests multiple capabilities:

- Physics simulation (gravity, friction, collision detection)
- Geometric calculations (rotating hexagon, bounce angles)
- Real-time graphics programming
- Code organization and clarity
- Performance optimization
